-- Basics of git --

git init => initialize a new .git repository
git add -A => adds all untracked dir and files
git commit -m "msg" => commits all tracked dirs and files
git push => push to github all the commited dirs and filles

-- Branching and Merging --

git checkout -b branch_name => create new branch with name
git branch                  => lets you see all the branches
Once you made some changes to the new branch (working on development)
you are ready to push the changing into the master (production) branch.
First you have to checkout (move to the master branch)
git checkout master => move to master branch

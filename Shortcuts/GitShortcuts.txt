-- Basics of git --

git init => initialize a new .git repository
git add -A => adds all untracked dir and files
git commit -m "msg" => commits all tracked dirs and files
git push => push to github all the commited dirs and filles

-- Branching and Merging --

git checkout -b branch_name => create new branch with name
git branch                  => lets you see all the branches
Once you made some changes to the new branch (working on development)
you are ready to push the changing into the master (production) branch.
First you have to checkout (move to the master branch)

git add -A && git commit -m "" => adds and commits all the dirs/files before moving to master
git checkout master         => move to master branch
git merge branch_name_to_merge => merge the branch into master

-- Github push clone and pulling --

git clone url dir_name => copy all the dirs and files from url into dir_name
git pull               => pulling from remote all the update made by
                          teammates
git push
